## Intro
There are a lot of things that I don't know. That's fine. It's all part of the process. Nobody is going to know everything - but it's still good to know some things. Exploring what would be helpful for me as I complete my schooling, I've found that a lot of what is helpful in "industry" jobs are tools. From my perspective, these are just things that I need to have experience with, and I think my knowledge of the concepts involved with those tools will transfer quite nicely.

Because of this, I'm going to make a schedule for different projects that I can do. I'll do two every week, essentially exploring the basics of different topics that will be relevent in the industry. A week has seven days, so what I'll do is use Sunday to plan out the two projects for the week, and then three days for project one, and the second three days for project two.

I've seen a lot of portfolio projects, and I understand why people make them. They're a good way to show that you understand different concepts. That's fine. *However*, I would much prefer to do something that's inspired. Something that I care about, that I'm interested in. Something that I think is worth my time. With this in mind, I'd like to create projects that seem like they're a bit more than a "standard" portfolio project. Yes, the goal is to be able to finish the project in three days, but still - there's no reason that I can't reach for something that's at least a little interesting.

At the end of the day, it's all about being able to use a tool to achieve a goal. What other tools you use with it don't necessarily impact the effectiveness of this exercise, so maybe I can combine some tools into something that's inspired. We'll see.
