## Intro
Artificial intelligence and humans both have their places, but oftentimes, they aren't the same place.

I thought about making this site myself for quite some time before realizing that the return on my time wasn't worth it. Yes, I could come up with a site like this, but it's important to recognize when you should be using each of the tools that are available to you.

There are a few different factors that impact whether something should use AI. One of these is care.

## Care (and Skill Level)
If something needs to be done carefully, AI should probably not be doing it - at least by itself.

My skills at this point working with AI as a coding assistant are proficient, but I can still recognize that when I'm working with a system that MUST WORK, and where failure is catastrophic, I don't trust AI to do most of the work. If it's a system (such as this website) where it working "most of the time" is good enough, then yes, AI is fine. To contrast the use of AI on this website, I want to point out these ideas. AI isn't being used for these because the *purpose* of these ideas is to express *my ideas*. If I used AI, then what's the point of even having this section?


## Human Expression
Many creators have been called out for using AI to generate a lot of content, including scripts, images, and audio. There has been a bit of controversy over when it's okay to use AI for things like this, but my opinion is quite clear... I think. Human expression adds something to content. What that is exactly is a bit difficult to describe, but it's similar to intention, soul... and maybe some other words too. The more AI that is used while creating content, the less soul there is in that content. Let's take the example of AI-generated audio. By using that, the creator is missing out on the opportunity to infuse expression into that audio - the purpose of whatever that content is. The AI will almost certainly miss the high highs, low lows, and the nuances between those that a human voice actor could provide. There's certainly a point where "art" becomes soulless due to a lack of expression and intentionality. There's no voice, and people can tell.

That being said, there is a way to do AI that I think still allows for human expression, and this returns AI to the simple "tool" status that I think it should be (generally). There's no reason for AI to be "steering the ship", if you will, while creating art. That causes the content to lose its status as art. If the artist has a vision, and I mean a *clear* vision, then they can guide the AI to create the vision that exists in the artist's mind. To me this is no different than using a brush to create the strokes that a painter envisions. Once this process is led by an AI, you're simply letting the machine spew out its training data, and it's no longer your expression.

## A Note on Artistry and the Lack of Content
I think there's something beautiful about a lack of content, a blank canvas. For me, it's very soothing to know that nothing has been created yet, whether that's for a coding project or an artistic project. Things can go in any direction. The nothingness almost prompts your mind to conjure something up, and that's where some of the best connections to creativity show up. Yes, it's usually easier to get something done if it's already started for you, but when it comes to artistic expression or something that you really care about, it's usually better to set the foundation yourself rather than let a (generally) non-deterministic machine do it for you.
