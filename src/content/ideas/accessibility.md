Best practices for creating web applications that are accessible to everyone.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility ensures that your web applications can be used by people with disabilities, including those who use assistive technologies.

## Key Principles

### Semantic HTML

Use proper HTML elements to convey meaning and structure.

### ARIA Labels

When semantic HTML isn't enough, use ARIA attributes to provide additional context.

### Keyboard Navigation

Ensure all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard.

### Color Contrast

Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for text readability.

## Conclusion

Building accessible applications isn't just the right thing to do—it also improves the experience for all users.
